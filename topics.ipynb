    "     - **Caching** and **persisting** DataFrames (e.g., `cache()`, `persist()`).\n",
    "     - **Skewed data** handling techniques (e.g., salting).\n",
    "     - Reducing the **shuffle** operations (tuning `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).\n",
    "     - **Predicate pushdown** and **column pruning**.\n",
    "     - Using **Tungsten** and **Catalyst optimizers**.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - **Topic:**\n",
    "     - Tuning **driver** and **executor memory**.\n",
    "     - Configuring **executor cores** and memory settings.\n",
    "     - Understanding the **dynamic resource allocation** and **back-pressure** handling.\n",
    "     - Tuning **parallelism** and **partitioning** based on the workload.\n",
    "     - YARN-specific settings (e.g., configuring containers and resource management).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Handling Big Data**\n",
    "   - **Topic:**\n",
    "     - Efficient reading/writing of large data (e.g., **Parquet**, **ORC**, **Avro**, **JSON**).\n",
    "     - Use of **bucketing** and **partitioning** for large datasets.\n",
    "     - Working with distributed file systems like **HDFS** and **S3**.\n",
    "     - **Compression techniques** (e.g., Snappy, Gzip, LZO) for efficient storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **DataFrame API & SQL**\n",
